# Ready-Pet-Go!

Ready pet go is a Tinder style interface for PetFinder.com, which is a website that is used to find adoptable shelter animals.

Petfinder has listing from all over the USA and is widely used to find animals


By creating a fun an interactive interface we can further encourage adoption of rescue animals, reducing populations in animal shelters and therefore reducing the number of cats and dogs put to sleep every day.

By randomly displaying cats or dogs near the user we can further encourage the adoption of animals that have been at a shelter for longer than others.
	-> sometimes people avoid adopting an animal that has been at a shelter for a “long” time as they assume that there is some kind of issue that is preventing others from adopting that animal.
	-> a tinder style interface could de-emphasize the amount of time an animal has been a resident at the shelter

Due to tinder’s popularity , the swipe right to show interest in a potential date, or in this case potential pet, is widely understood by the general population, especially among the younger demographic.

These interfaces could encourage shelter animal adoption by a younger audience, which will also help to reduce shelter populations.

The problem: not enough people adopt animals from shelters.
	—> many people still buy from breeders when they would be even happier with a shelter animal

The solution: increase adoption of shelter animals by creating a fun and interactive user interface for petfinder.com
